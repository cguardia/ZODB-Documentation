Notes about intended audience
=============================

Due to the Python-centric nature of the ZODB, familiarity with Python will be
assumed for this book. This means that we will have no sections on what is
Python, Python's strenghts and installation.

At this point, I think it's also safe to assume that PyPi will be known to
prospective ZODB developers, thus no easy_install explanation either.

The intended audience might be defined therefore as Python developers who are
looking for an easy way to store their application's information.
