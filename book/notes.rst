Notes about possible material
=============================

This is a place to collect thoughts and ideas about material to cover in the
book, including links to articles or packages that can be helpful.

 - Should the pickle module be covered in detail?
 - Include configuration for setting up a remote ZEO server. Is it enough to
   set shared_blob_dir=False?
 - Gotcha sent this URL for undoing transactions:

 - Nice script by mcdonc to find FileStorage transactions later than some date:
